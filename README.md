***Description***

Personal Lending System (PLS) is a software solution, designed to help the Lender’s life much easier by keeping their Creditors’ records safe in one place. Instead of manually writing down every creditor’s borrowed money or product on a paper, the Lender can just type it directly in the PLS. The system will then take care of keeping the data safe and organized to make searching extra fast than keeping it in a physical record book.
